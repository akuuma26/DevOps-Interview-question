1. What happens if a pod enters CrashLoopBackOff repeatedly?
-> The kubelet keeps restarting it. But it won’t recover unless you fix the root cause — commonly bad env configs, failing probes, image errors, or missing mounts.

2. What happens if CoreDNS fails inside the cluster?
->Services can’t resolve each other by name. Apps break silently. curl fails. Debug with nslookup, kubectl logs -n kube-system, and always monitor DNS latency.

3. What happens if a node runs out of memory?
-> Kubelet starts evicting pods. Your app gets killed silently. Node marked MemoryPressure=True. Run kubectl describe node and top node to catch early signals.

4. What happens if the service selector doesn’t match any pods?
-> The service exists, but traffic goes nowhere. You’ll get “connection refused” errors. Always use kubectl get endpoints to confirm backend pod IPs.

5. What happens when an unready pod gets traffic?
-> If readiness probes are misconfigured or missing, kube-proxy routes traffic to broken pods. Monitor startup delays & readiness gating in your manifests.

6. What happens if etcd fails?
-> Kubernetes control plane becomes read-only or fails. No new pods can be scheduled. API server fails. This is your cluster’s brain. Backup frequently.

7. What happens if you run a rolling deploy with a bad config?
->You might take down every pod one by one. Without a maxUnavailable set, the app can go down completely. Set proper deployment strategies + prechecks.

8. What happens when the kubelet loses connectivity to the API server?
-> The node enters NotReady. No new pods get scheduled; existing pods may keep running, but updates fail. Node might get cordoned or evicted.

9. What happens if HPA scales up too aggressively?
-> Your app overloads the node or consumes all quota. Can lead to pod evictions, degraded performance, or even node crashes if limits aren’t set.

10. What happens when a container exits with code 0, but the app is broken?
-> Kubernetes thinks it’s “healthy” unless your probes catch it. Add proper liveness & readiness probes to ensure status reflects reality.

1) What happens if your state file is accidentally deleted?
Answer: Terraform loses track of all managed infrastructure. On the next apply, it will attempt to recreate everything from scratch, potentially causing conflicts with existing resources.

2) What happens if multiple team members run terraform apply simultaneously?
Answer: State file locking fails, risking corrupted state and inconsistent infrastructure. One process succeeds while others error out, potentially leading to drift if not managed properly.

3) What happens if a resource fails halfway through a terraform apply?
Answer: Terraform leaves successfully created resources running but marks the state as tainted. Subsequent apply operations will attempt to recreate failed resources, but you're left in partial state.

4) What happens when AWS API rate limits are hit during a large terraform apply?
Answer: Operations fail with throttling errors. Terraform retries a few times then fails the apply. Resources created before the limit was hit remain, creating partial deployments.

5) What happens if terraform plan shows no changes but infrastructure was modified outside Terraform?
Answer: Terraform won't detect the drift until you run terraform refresh or terraform plan -refresh-only. This can lead to unexpected behavior when making future changes.

6) What happens if you delete a resource definition from your configuration?
Answer: On next apply, Terraform will destroy that resource in your infrastructure unless you use terraform state rm to remove it from state first or use lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }.

7) What happens if a provider API changes between Terraform versions?
Answer: You may encounter compatibility issues and failed plans/applies. Resources might need to be rebuilt or configurations updated to match new API requirements.

8) What happens if you have circular dependencies in your Terraform modules?
Answer: Terraform will fail to initialize or plan with dependency cycle errors. You'll need to refactor your module structure to break the circular references.

9) What happens if you exceed AWS service quotas during deployment?
Answer: Resources will fail to create with quota exceeded errors. Terraform marks them as failed, and you'll need to request quota increases before retrying the apply

10) What happens if you lose access to the remote backend storing your state?
Answer: All Terraform operations fail until access is restored. Teams can't collaborate, and changes can't be applied safely. This effectively blocks all infrastructure changes.

🟩 1. Terraform
What happens if your Terraform state file is accidentally deleted?
→ Terraform loses track of all resources and may attempt to recreate infrastructure on next apply.

What happens if multiple team members run terraform apply simultaneously?
→ Risk of state corruption; only one operation should lock the state file.

What happens if a resource fails midway during terraform apply?
→ Terraform leaves a partial state; tainted resources are retried on next apply.

What happens when AWS API rate limits are hit during a large Terraform apply?
→ Terraform retries, but the apply may eventually fail, leaving partial infrastructure.

How do you detect if the infrastructure was changed outside of Terraform?
→ Use terraform refresh or terraform plan -refresh-only to sync.

What happens when you delete a resource from the Terraform config?
→ It will be destroyed unless removed from state using terraform state rm.

What if a provider API changes between Terraform versions?
→ Compatibility issues may arise; refactor modules/resources accordingly.

How does Terraform handle circular dependencies in modules?
→ Plan/init fails with dependency cycle error; restructure modules.

What happens if you exceed AWS service quotas during deployment?
→ Resources fail to create; request quota increases before retrying.

What if you lose access to the remote backend storing your state?
→ Terraform operations fail until access is restored.

How do Terraform locks work?
→ Remote backends (like S3 with DynamoDB) use locking to avoid concurrent operations.

How do you manage module dependencies in Terraform?
→ Use depends_on, correct outputs/inputs, and isolated state files if needed.

Difference between terraform fmt vs terraform validate?
→ fmt formats code; validate checks syntax correctness.

What are null resources and local-exec in Terraform?
→ Used for provisioning tasks not covered by providers (e.g., shell scripts).

What are alternatives to storing secrets in .tfstate?
→ Use tools like Vault, SSM Parameter Store, or external data sources.

What is the difference between for_each and for in Terraform?
→ for_each is for resource creation; for is used within expressions or variables.

How do Terraform modules work and why use them?
→ Reusable blocks of configuration for better organization and DRY code.

Purpose of the Terraform state file and how is it managed?
→ Tracks infrastructure state; store securely (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB).

What is DynamoDB’s role in Terraform?
→ Used for state locking when the backend is S3.

How do you avoid conflicts with the Terraform state file?
→ Use remote state with locking, avoid concurrent applies.

How do you create a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform?
→ Use modules like eks (AWS) or google_container_cluster (GCP).

🟦 2. Docker
What is Docker (in your own words)?
→ A containerization platform for running isolated apps with all dependencies.

How do you build an image and run a container?
→ docker build -t image-name . then docker run image-name.

How do you create a container from an image?
→ docker run command with appropriate flags.

What happens if a Docker container is deleted?
→ The container and its writable layer are removed unless volumes are used.

What are Namespaces in Docker?
→ Kernel features used to isolate containers (PID, Net, IPC, etc.).

What is Docker build cache?
→ Speeds up builds by reusing unchanged layers.

How do you share Docker images across organizations?
→ Use Docker Hub, ECR, or private registries with access control.

How do you extract a .tar for Docker use?
→ docker load < image.tar.

Command to remove all stopped containers?
→ docker container prune or docker rm $(docker ps -aq -f status=exited).

Stages in Docker images?
→ Multi-stage builds (builder + runtime stages).

Why do we use ENTRYPOINT and CMD in Dockerfiles?
→ ENTRYPOINT defines the main command; CMD provides default arguments.

Where do you store Docker images?
→ Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GitHub Container Registry, etc.

How to reduce Docker image size?
→ Use smaller base images, clean cache, multi-stage builds.

🟥 3. Kubernetes (K8s)
Explain Kubernetes architecture in simple terms.
→ Master node (API, Scheduler, Controller) + Worker nodes (kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime).

Have you set up a K8s cluster from scratch? How?
→ Tools like kubeadm, kops, or Terraform with cloud providers.

What does kubectl apply do?
→ Applies or updates Kubernetes resources from YAML files.

How do you check pod logs?
→ kubectl logs <pod-name>.

How do you launch a pod using a Docker image?
→ Define in a YAML manifest (image: my-image) and apply.

What’s the difference between a pod and a container?
→ Pod = group of containers + shared storage/network.

Can multiple pods run under a single deployment?
→ Yes, replicas of the same pod definition.

What is CrashLoopBackOff? How to debug it?
→ Pod keeps crashing repeatedly; check logs, liveness probes, init containers.

What is an ImagePullBackOff?
→ Failed to fetch the image; causes include wrong image name, missing auth.

Command to go inside a pod?
→ kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash.

How to attach a ConfigMap to a pod?
→ Use envFrom or volumeMounts in the pod spec.

ConfigMap not reflecting?
→ May require pod restart or re-mount. Check subPath.

Pod stuck in Terminating state—how to fix?
→ Force delete with --grace-period=0 --force. Check finalizers.

Steps to create a Kubernetes cluster?
→ Choose provider/tool (EKS, Minikube, kubeadm), set up master + worker nodes.

What is the master node and other nodes?
→ Master handles control plane; worker nodes run application pods.

How can you create Kubernetes classes (e.g., StorageClass)?
→ Define YAML with kind: StorageClass or ResourceQuota, etc.

Kubernetes errors and resolutions (general)?
→ Common: CrashLoop, ImagePull, OOMKilled — use describe, logs, events.

How do you integrate Prometheus with K8s?
→ Helm charts or custom manifests; set service annotations for scraping.

How do you define resource limits in K8s?
→ In pod spec: resources.requests and resources.limits.

Design a multi-tenant K8s architecture to isolate workloads.
→ Use namespaces, resource quotas, network policies, PSPs.
